HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
HTTP is the protocol used for communication between a web browser (client) and a web server. It governs how data is requested and transferred over the internet. When you enter a URL in your browser's address bar and hit Enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which contains the requested web content (usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It's responsible for defining the elements on a webpage, such as text, images, links, headings, and more. HTML is used to create the content that browsers interpret and display. It's the foundation of the web and is often combined with other technologies like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

XML XPath (XML Path Language):
XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language used to navigate and select elements from XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents. It provides a way to address parts of an XML document, allowing you to extract specific data or perform various operations on XML content. XPath is commonly used in various contexts, including web scraping, data extraction, and working with XML-based data formats.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables web designers and developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to HTML elements. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can create visually appealing and consistent web designs.
